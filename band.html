            <p>
                    Ben&Ben, formerly known as The Benjamins, are a folk pop/pop rock band in the Philippines. Formed in 2015, the band 
                    have since been known for their popularhits that include "Pagtingin" and "Lifetime", among others.One of the
                    most popular acts in the Philippines, they have been ranked as the most-streamed Filipino artist on Spotify for two 
                    straight years, specifically in 2020 and 2021.They have won several awards, including multiple Awit Awards, Myx Awards, 
                    and Wish Awards. Their debut studio album Limasawa Street was certified 3× Platinum in the Philippines by PARI after earning 45,000 copy sales.</p>

                    At th is point, who doesn’t know Ben&Ben? Whether you’re a member of their dedicated fandom, or just a casual listener, chances are you will have heard at least one of their songs.
                    It is no surprise that Filipinos have taken so easily to this band. There is hardly any edge or angst to Ben&Ben’s music. Their catalog is largely a wholesome affair, made up of the 
                    kind of songs you would play on a long drive, a rainy day, or any other moment that invites introspection.Perhaps crucial to their success as an OPM band is their unapologetic sentimentality,
                    their proclivity toward love songs.From a song about looking forward to coming home to someone at the end of a journey (2016’s “Ride Home”), to a song about wanting to press pause on a particularly 
                    tender moment with a lover (2017’s “Maybe The Night”) to a track about a love that could have been but never was, (2020’s “Lifetime”),
            <p>
                    the band has managed to capture love and desire in all its iterations.
                    It might be that no other band in recent years has written so much about longing.Before Ben&Ben became Ben&Ben, they were The Benjamins,with twins Paolo and Miguel Guico sharing vocals and guitar duties, and 
                    Paolo also playing the keys. Like many musically-inclined high school students in the 2000s, the twins would “jam” with their friends after classes and perform in amateur band competitions. That might have been 
                    as far as their music career had gone – they ended up pursuing engineering in college – but as chance would have it, they saw an ad for Elements Music Camp on Facebook and decided to join.Their education at Elements 
                    soon bore fruit. In 2016, The Benjamins won 2nd runner-up and Best Music Video at the PhilPop Music Festival with the song “Tinatangi,” which was performed by OPM legends Bayang Barrios and Cooky Chua. (AUG 28, 2021 9:03 AM PHT
